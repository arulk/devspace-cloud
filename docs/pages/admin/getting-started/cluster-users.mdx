<Step>1</Step>

:::note User Limits
DevSpace Cloud allows you to customize the user limits when generating an invite link. By default, the UI shows the option to limit the number of Spaces. Click on "Show" to customize all available user limits.

<br/>
<Step>2</Step> 

Send the invite link to your colleague

:::note Signup via Invite
Your colleagues does **not** need to have an account yet. DevSpace Cloud will display the login or sign up page when the user clicks on the invite link and is not logged in yet.
:::

<br/>
<Step>3</Step> 

Your colleague clicks on the link and accepts the invite

:::note Encryption Key
<Highlight backgroundColor="#3333dd">SaaS edition</Highlight> When clicking on an invite link for the first time, the user needs to specify an encryption key. Users should remember this key and treat it like a password for your cluster.

## Create Teams
Instead of adding users to individual clusters, it is often better to create a team and give the team access to the cluster.

<br/>
<Step>1</Step> 

Create a team for your organization

<Step>2</Step> 

Transfer personal clusters to your team

:::note Cluster Users ðŸ¡† Team Members
When tranferring a cluster to a team, all cluster users will automatically become team members.

</figure>


<br/>
<Step>3</Step> 

Manage cluster users just like with personal cluster

After tranferring a cluster to a team, you can keep generating invite links for this cluster as shown above. Users will automatically become part of the team once they accept the first invite link to a cluster that is owned by this team.

:::note Team Member â‰  Cluster Access
Although you can generate invite links just to add people to a team, these team members will not have any access to the clusters.

<br/>
<Step>4</Step>

Use the shared image registry of your team

Every team member has access to the shared team registry and can pull/push Docker images using this registry.
